# MediRAG-AI-Powered-RAG-Assistant-for-Healthcare
🚀 Just deployed my **AI-powered Healthcare RAG Assistant**!

After weeks of learning, coding, and debugging — I'm thrilled to share a project that merges **AI + Healthcare** in a meaningful way!

🩺 What it does: 
🔹 Reads patient records from MIMIC-IV-Ext 
🔹 Chunks, pads, and embeds the text 
🔹 Stores it using FAISS & retrieves via BM25 
🔹 Uses a language model to answer medical questions in context 

🧠 Built with: 
🧩 Python 
🛠️ FAISS 
🔍 BM25 
🗣️ Sentence Transformers 
🎛️ Streamlit (for an easy-to-use frontend)

💬 Sample questions it can handle: 
❓ “What treatment was used for this patient’s chest pain?” 
❓ “How did shortness of breath correlate with past cardiac issues?” 
❓ “Was nitroglycerin effective in this case?”
